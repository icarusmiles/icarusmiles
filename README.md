<div>
  <p>A cloud engineer with a passion for SRE and DevOps. <span>&#x1F4BB;</span> My programming expertise lies in serverless programming and web app development using JavaScript, Node.js, and Python.</p>
  <p><span>&#x1F680;</span> With 9 years of experience in the field, I have developed a strong foundation in cloud computing, microservices architecture, and containerization. My goal is to help businesses leverage the power of the cloud to enhance their operations and improve their bottom line. <span>&#x1F4AA;</span></p>
  <p>When I'm not busy building cloud infrastructure, you can find me tinkering with new technologies or contributing to open-source projects. <span>&#x1F6E0;</span> I believe in the power of collaboration and sharing knowledge to drive innovation forward. <span>&#x1F465;</span> If you have a project that you think could benefit from my expertise, feel free to reach out to me on GitHub. I would love to hear from you! <span>&#x1F4E9;</span></p>
  <p><span>&#x1F52D;</span> In my free time, I love stargazing and exploring the universe. <span>&#x1F30C;</span> I'm also an avid traveler, always looking for new places to discover. <span>&#x2708;&#xFE0F;</span> When I'm not traveling, I enjoy hiking and spending time in nature. <span>&#x1F333;</span></p>
  <p><span>&#x1F4DA;</span> I'm a lifelong learner and enjoy reading about a wide range of topics, from science and technology to philosophy and psychology. <span>&#x1F4D6;</span> I also enjoy watching documentaries and learning new things on YouTube. <span>&#x1F3A5;</span></p>
  <p>Thanks for stopping by! <span>&#x1F64F;</span></p>
