👋 Hi there! I'm Miles Collier, a cloud engineer with a passion for SRE and DevOps. 💻 My programming expertise lies in serverless programming and web app development using JavaScript, Node.js, and Python.

🚀 With 9 years of experience in the field, I have developed a strong foundation in cloud computing, microservices architecture, and containerization. My goal is to help businesses leverage the power of the cloud to enhance their operations and improve their bottom line. 💪

When I'm not busy building cloud infrastructure, you can find me tinkering with new technologies or contributing to open-source projects. 🛠️ I believe in the power of collaboration and sharing knowledge to drive innovation forward. 👥 If you have a project that you think could benefit from my expertise, feel free to reach out to me on GitHub. I would love to hear from you! 📩

🔭 In my free time, I love stargazing and exploring the universe. 🌌 I'm also an avid traveler, always looking for new places to discover. ✈️ When I'm not traveling, I enjoy hiking and spending time in nature. 🌳

📚 I'm a lifelong learner and enjoy reading about a wide range of topics, from science and technology to philosophy and psychology. 📖 I also enjoy watching documentaries and learning new things on YouTube. 🎥

Thanks for stopping by! 🙏
